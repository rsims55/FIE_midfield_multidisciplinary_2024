\section{Merged draft}\label{merged-draft}}

The computing domain has historically engaged with other branches of
study to create new interdisciplinary programs. These specialized
programs offer both a targeted approach for solving complex issues as
well as acting as a point of attraction for students to enroll is one
university over another. The curriculum of these interdisciplinary
programs often include courses from their respective ``parent'' fields.
For example, bioinformatics curriculum can include courses from both
computer science departments as well as biology departments.

The Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Engineering
Longitudinal Development (MIDFIELD) project has collected complete
course records of every student's path towards degree for eighteen
Universities across the United States of America. This data allows us to
construct sets of courses that students chose to complete to fulfill
their institution's requirements for graduation. We interpret this set
of courses as representing the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs)
of the students who graduate with a given degree, which we use as our
theoretical framework.

This work analyses the robust MIDFIELD data set in order to identify
overlaps between interdisciplinary degree course requirements and their
``parent'' degree course requirements. The set of courses that are
shared between curricula can indicate to curriculum designers both the
set of courses that other institutions have deemed sufficiently relevant
to include, and also the courses that have been offered through other
departments.

This study helps lay groundwork for promoting interdisciplinary majors
between computing and other STEM fields. Research has demonstrated how a
diverse team of computing-enabled professionals contributes
significantly to solving complex problems. Implementing
interdisciplinary majors can make computer science programs more
attractive to students with marginalized identities who seek to bridge
the gap between their lived experiences and the fundamentals of computer
science. As such, this study aims to identify fundamental computer
science courses that other programs can use and extend to create
interdisciplinary majors.

\hypertarget{tims-draft}{%
\section{Tim's Draft}\label{tims-draft}}

A major contribution of the computing sciences historically has been to
enable other branches of science the knowledge and skills to further
their own endeavors with the use of computation.

This has led to the creation of several interdisciplinary fields such as
bioinformatics, computational chemistry, and computational physics.
These specialized fields offer both a targeted approach towards
furthering our collective knowledge as well as acting as a point of
attraction for students to enroll is one university over another.

The curriculum of these interdisciplinary programs often include courses
from their respective ``parent'' fields. For example, bioinformatics
curriculum can include courses from both computer science departments as
well as biology departments. The number of courses that are specific to
the ``child'' field need not be as large as the number of courses
offered by the ``parent'' field(s).

The MIDFIELD project provides a robust and detailed data set of the
courses that students have taken as they complete their degrees. This
project uses the MIDFIELD data set to determine the courses that
students have taken on their paths to degree completion. The dataset has
course information dating back to 19XX, and can therefore reveal
interdisciplinary degree creation and growth over time.

Curriculum analysis is suited for quantitatve methods of analysis due to
the size and quantifiability of the courses that comprise a curriculum.

This work presents a quantitative analysis of overlapping courses that
students have taken as they completed computer science and related
interdisciplinary undergraduate degrees. Detecting the course overlaps
from a large dataset such as MIDFILED gives insights into the core
courses that universities have required students to complete. The
overlap between computer science and interdisciplinary courses can be
used by curriculm designers to determine which courses would most
quickly develop new interdisciplinary programs. For example, if a large
portion of a desired but not yet implemented program is already offered
by a university, then this study can identify which courses are highly
critical to the creation of the new program.

\hypertarget{problem-statement}{%
\subsection{Problem statement}\label{problem-statement}}

Degree programs for computer science students are often rigid, giving
students few choices in courses, course sequences, and time to
graduation. Courses within these degree programs have historically been
accessible only to computer science majors. In recent years {[}maybe{]},
universities have begun to shift particular computing courses to
intersect with those in other departments which rely on computational
methods, such as biology (bioinformatics) and genetics (genomics).

\hypertarget{importance-of-interdisciplinary}{%
\subsection{Importance of
interdisciplinary}\label{importance-of-interdisciplinary}}

Interdisciplinary degree programs such as these allow for a diversity of
entrance pathways for students from non-traditional backgrounds. These
differing entrance pathways can promote inclusivity, allowing students
multiple routes to graduation not outlined in a rigid degree pathway.
While the importance of interdisciplinary fields and programs are
well-known, the extent to which courses overlap between degree programs
has not been investigated.

\hypertarget{theoretical-framework}{%
\subsection{Theoretical Framework}\label{theoretical-framework}}

\hypertarget{gap-the-work-fills}{%
\subsection{Gap the work fills}\label{gap-the-work-fills}}

Our work seeks to better understand the flexibility of these courses and
their utilization within and between different degree programs through
the following research questions:

\hypertarget{rqs-and-hypotheses}{%
\subsection{RQs and hypotheses}\label{rqs-and-hypotheses}}

RQ1: What are the most overlapping degree programs in the computing
disciplines? RQ2: What are the most frequent courses to migrate between
within computing disciplines?

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}}

This project uses data from {[}x{]} institutions retrieved from the
MIDFIELD (Multi-Institutional Database for Investigating Engineering
Longitudinal Development). Using techniques from Boolean algebra and
descriptive statistics, we identified undergraduate degree programs with
the highest and lowest percentages of overlap with computer science
curriculums. We then used course data within the degree programs to
determine the levels of course overlap between degree programs.

\hypertarget{results}{%
\subsection{Results}\label{results}}

Our findings show {[}x{]} degree programs as having large (x)
percentages of overlap with computer science programs. {[}go into
courses that make up these programs and their overlap{]}

\hypertarget{impacts}{%
\subsection{Impacts}\label{impacts}}

Results from this project indicate specific degrees and courses which
allow students easy entry points to an interdisciplinary degree pathway.
