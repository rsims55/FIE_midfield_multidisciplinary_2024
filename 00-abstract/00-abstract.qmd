  This document describes the most common article elements and how to use the 
  `quarto-ieee` class with Pandoc/Quarto-Markdown to produce files that are
  suitable for submission to IEEE journals.  
  `quarto-ieee` can produce conference, journal, and technical note (correspondence) 
  papers with a suitable choice of class options. 
  It intends to generate PDF and HTML outputs that closely mimick what IEEE would generate.

## Tim's Draft

A major contribution of the computing sciences historically has been to enable other branches of science the knowledege and skills to further their own endeavors with the use of computation.

This has led to the creation of many multidisciplinary fields such as bioinformatics, computational chemistry, and computational physics. These specialized fields offer both a targeted approach towards furthering our collective knowledge as well as acting as a point of attraction for steudents to enroll is one university over another. 

The curriculum of these multidisciplinary programs often include courses from their respective "parent" fields. For example, bioinformatics curriculum can include courses from both computer science departments as well as biology departments. The number of courses that are specific to the "child" field need not be as large as the number of courses offered by the "parent" field(s). 

The MIDFIELD project provides a robust and detailed data set of the courses that students have taken as they complete their degrees. This project uses the MIDFIELD data set to determine the courses likely
